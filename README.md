# Fourier-Visualized

Requirements - 

1) Manim - Rendering Library for python
2) Inkscape - Used to obtain outline of an image
3) Node modules in Parser.js to convert the outline to readable JSON file

The CVF.py contains the info (coordinates from JSON File) to be fed into Fourier.py. The code after the TESTING can be modified to get a CSV file which can be loaded onto MATLAB or Octave

The Fourier.py contains the necessary functions to obtain the initial conditions for the epicycle setup and renders it.
